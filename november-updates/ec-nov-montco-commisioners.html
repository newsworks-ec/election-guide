                        Joe Gale, 26, is from Landsdale and has never held political office, though he maintains he has been active in conservative groups from a young age. Since graduating from Temple University with a bachelor’s degree in Finance and Real Estate, he has worked for the Montgomery Recorder of Deeds Office and NVR, a home building company. At 23, he ran for a council position in Plymouth Township and lost. He said his pro-life stance was one of his main motivations for getting into the race, and maintains that “moral character” is a big part of his campaign. He promises to be tougher on crime in Norristown and vote against tax increases.
