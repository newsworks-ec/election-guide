                            James H. Foster was born in Philadelphia in 1942 and has lived his entire life in the area, mostly in Germantown and Mt. Airy. He worked his way through LaSalle University as an auto mechanic (with a two-year interruption for service in the U.S. Marine Corps), graduating in 1967 with a B.A. in pre-law. After working at First Pennsylvania Banking & Trust, Foster opened an auto repair, restoration and sales business in 1972 and operated it until 2011. He became involved in community affairs in 1995 and, in 2009, founded the Independent Voice newspaper (formerly the Germantown Chronicle/Northwest Independent), a media outlet that focuses on city and state issues, particularly corruption and neglect in government.

                            Osborne Hart, 63, works as an overnight stocker at Walmart. He is part of the movement of retail, fast food, home care, airport and other workers for $15-an-hour minimum wage, full-time work and union representation. A lifelong supporter of black people's rights, he was a participant in the July 24-26 Black Lives Matter national conference in Cleveland. He also supports a woman’s right to have an abortion, has marched and spoken out in support of undocumented workers in Philadelphia, Norristown and southern New Jersey, and has joined protests and rallies against public school funding cuts. Hart believes that education’s focus should be realigned from what he calls the capitalist model of preparation for a life of labor in competition with fellow workers to a lifelong process that advances society and expands culture.
