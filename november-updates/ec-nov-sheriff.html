                        Sheriff Jewell Williams, 58,  was sworn in to lead the Office of the Sheriff City and County of Philadelphia in January 2012 after his election in  November 2011.   Before being elected sheriff, Williams served 11 years as state representative of the 197th Legislative District. He pushed for more affordable housing for the poor, as well as creation of the Susquehanna Neighborhood Advisory Council (SNAC) in response to increased violence in parts of his district. In his first year in office, Sheriff Williams orchestrated a new working agreement with the City of Philadelphia and the First Judicial District to increase transparency. He has also increased efforts to return money to property owners whose properties have been sold for more than the outstanding debts, and has held numerous foreclosure-prevention seminars and workshops across the city. His office holds monthly sessions on how to purchase a property at a sheriff's sale.
