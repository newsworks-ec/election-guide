                    <p>Councilman William Greenlee, 62, is a lifelong resident of the Fairmount neighborhood of Philadelphia. He is a graduate of St. Joseph’s Prep and Temple University. He and his wife Leslie, a teacher, have been married for over 25 years. In 1980, he began a 26-year career working as chief aide to City Councilman David Cohen, providing constituent services and working on legislative issues. He was elected to City Council in 2006. Championing earned paid sick leave in Philadelphia is one of Councilman Greenlee’s most recent legislative accomplishments. Greenlee also introduced a bill protecting the rights of pregnant workers and women who are nursing. Councilman Greenlee was the sponsor of legislation to overhaul the Fair Practices ordinance, which is the City’s Civil Rights Legislation. The Ordinance prohibits discrimination in housing, employment and public accommodations. The update of the law expands the protected classes of citizens to include domestic violence victims, the disabled and the LGBT community."</p>

                       John Staggs, 68, was born in Illinois and worked on a farm there. Currently a Walmart cashier and a supporter of the fight for a union, Staggs has been using his Council campaign to support Verizon workers and ATI steelworkers in their contract fights. Staggs is also an opponent of U.S. wars he calls imperialist — in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere – and he supports the revolutionary government in Cuba as an example for all working people. Staggs marched in the Philadelphia celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act and backs continuing fights to win equality and access for those with disabilities, including wounded veterans. A candidate for the PA House of Representatives (Northwest Philly’s 198th District) in 2006, Staggs used that campaign to overturn the loyalty oath required of political candidates in Pennsylvania.

                        Andrew Stober, 36, says he has a passion for Philadelphia and a belief that city government can work efficiently and effectively is evident through his commitment to public service. From 2008 until earlier this year, he was director of strategic initiatives, then chief of staff of the Mayor’s Office of Transportation and Utilities. He secured federal grants for numerous transportation projects. He helped launch a pedestrian-safety effort, and reestablished a City energy office that has cut utility costs and increased use of renewable energy. Stober and his wife live in South Philly’s East Passyunk neighborhood. The son of public educators, he attended public schools before earning a BS in business administration from Northeastern University and a Master’s in public policy from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government.
