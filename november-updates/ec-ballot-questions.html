                        This proposed amendment to the Home Rule Charter would create a new Department of Planning and Development. The Department would be headed by the Director of Planning and Development who would be a member of the Mayor’s cabinet.

                    <p>
                        The Department would have three divisions: the Division of Development Services,the Division of Planning and Zoning,and the Division of Housing and Community Development. The Division of Development Serviceswould coordinate among various City and non-City agencies in providing support to development projects. The Division of Planning and Zoningwould provide administrative support to the Planning Commission, the Historical Commission, the Art Commission and the Zoning Board. The Division of Housing and Community Developmentwould be responsible for developing and carrying out the City’s housing and community development programs.

The Director of Planning and Development would replace the Director of Housing as a member of the Historical Commission, and one Mayoral appointment would be eliminated. The Housing Advisory Board would be created, consisting of twelve members (seven designated by various City and non-City agencies and five appointed by the Mayor); the Board would provide advice to the Division of Housing and Community Development regarding housing policy.

                        City Bond Question: Should the City of Philadelphia borrow ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE MILLION NINE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($155,965,000.00) to be spent for and toward capital purposes as follows: Transit; Streets and Sanitation; Municipal Buildings; Parks, Recreation and Museums; and Economic and Community Development?

                    <p>
                        This ballot question, if approved by the voters, would authorize the City to borrow $155,965,000 for capital purposes, thereby increasing the City’s indebtedness by $155,965,000. Capital purposes means, generally, to make expenditures that will result in something of value with a useful life to the City of more than five years, for example, acquisitions of real estate, or construction of or improvements to buildings, property or streets.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        The money to be borrowed would be used by the City for five identified purposes, namely, Transit; Streets and Sanitation; Municipal Buildings; Parks, Recreation and Museums; and Economic and Community Development, all in specific amounts identified in Bill No. 150507 (approved June 18, 2015). City Council would have authority, by ordinance, to change the intended allocation of these proceeds.
